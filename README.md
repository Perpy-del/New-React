# 0x01. React intro (A revised edition of React intro by ALX)

This project consists of a number of tasks created to help understand the concept of building a simple application with React.

Also included is the concept of creating an application using Webpack.

Then, the icing on the cake is creating test files to test the codes written in different components of the application.
